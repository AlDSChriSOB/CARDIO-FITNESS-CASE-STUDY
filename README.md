# CARDIO-FITNESS-CASE-STUDY

Overview:
This project analyzes the CardioGood Fitness dataset to uncover customer trends, segment audiences, and predict product preferences using machine learning techniques. The model was fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization and validated for improved predictive accuracy. Notably, two clusters exhibited a clear separation, yielding better segmentation for targeted marketing strategies.

Features:
Data Analysis: Summary statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer demographics. Visualization of product preferences across different customer segments.
Clustering: Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.
Enhanced model separation, with two dominant clusters exhibiting a distinct divide for better targeting.
Predictive Modeling: Classification models, specifically a Random Forest model, to predict treadmill product preferences.
Fine-tuned the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
Cross-validated using k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Actionable Insights: Recommendations for marketing strategies based on customer trends.
Skills Demonstrated:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing data.
EDA and Visualization: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for in-depth analysis and visual representation of customer data.
Clustering and Segmentation: Identifying two primary customer groups with a clear separation through K-Means clustering.
Improved segmentation for focused marketing and product development strategies.
Machine Learning and Model Tuning: Building and evaluating classification models. Fine-tuning the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV to optimize parameters like n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split for improved performance. Model validation with k-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
Python Libraries:Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Findings and Recommendations
Product Preferences:
    TM195 attracts younger, budget-conscious customers.
  TM498 is preferred by middle-income customers with moderate fitness goals.
  TM798 appeals to high-income individuals aiming for advanced fitness levels.
Customer Segments:
  Cluster 1: Younger, budget-conscious users with higher product engagement.
  Cluster 2: Middle-aged, moderate-income users seeking steady fitness progress.
  The separation between these two clusters was more pronounced, offering clearer targeting opportunities.
  Predictive Insights:

The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 85%, after fine-tuning, indicating strong predictive capabilities for product preferences.
Recommendations:
  Targeted Marketing:
  TM195: Focus on affordability and beginner-friendly features for younger customers.
  TM798: Highlight premium quality and advanced fitness capabilities for high-income users.
  Product Development: Customize treadmill features for each segment, e.g., tech-integrated treadmills for younger customers seeking fitness data tracking.
  Retention Strategies:Use loyalty programs and personalized offers to retain high-value customers in Cluster 2 (middle-aged, moderate-income users).
This portfolio showcases your ability to apply data science techniques, fine-tune machine learning models, and deliver actionable insights to solve real-world business challenges effectively, with a particular focus on segmenting customers more effectively for targeted actions.
